## Contribution
We are welcome to any and all forms of contribution. PRs for any feature in the Kustom app suite are welcome, but please do not add extra features yet as the file handeling system most likely won't support them. 

If you find any issue after alpha is released, _please_ create an [issue ticket](https://github.com/Anoms12/Kustom-Web-Editor/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).
